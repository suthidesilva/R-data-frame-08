# Earning in Esports

## Introduction

Esports, or video game competitions, have grown significantly in popularity over the past decade. This report focuses on the earnings generated by esports, using data obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on earnings from various game types from 1989 to 2020, along with details such as genre, top country, release year, and more. The primary goal of this project is to analyze the total revenue generated by different game genres.

## Data Cleaning

To clean the data, various steps were taken:

- Duplicated data points were removed.
- Entries with a total earning of zero were eliminated.
- Entries with missing or irrelevant data, such as "None" for top country, were removed.
- Outliers, such as a release year of 11, were corrected.

## Awful Representation

A pie chart was used to represent the data initially. However, it was deemed inadequate due to the lack of relevant information and difficulty in distinguishing between genres.

## Useful Representation

A bar graph was chosen as a more suitable representation of the data. This graph allows for easy comparison of earnings across different genres and provides numerical values for better understanding.

## Additional Visualization

A second graph was created to focus on the highest-earning game within the most profitable genre, which was Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA). Dota 2 was identified as the highest-earning game within this genre.

## Conclusion

From the analysis, it can be concluded that Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), with Dota 2 as the leading game, is the highest-earning genre in esports. This information is valuable for individuals seeking to earn money through gaming.
